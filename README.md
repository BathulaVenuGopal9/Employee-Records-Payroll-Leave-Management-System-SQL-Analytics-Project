# Enterprise Employee Management System — SQL End-to-End Data Project

# Project Overview

This project presents a complete SQL-based Employee Management System designed to manage, analyze, and interpret workforce-related data including employee records, salaries, bonuses, and leave activity.
Using a relational schema and advanced SQL operations, the system provides operational HR insights, salary analytics, and data-driven decision support for organizations.

The project demonstrates mastery of SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, grouping, conditional logic, subqueries, CTEs, and real-world HR analytics queries.

# Objectives

Build a structured database for managing employee details

Analyze salaries, bonuses, and payroll components

Track leaves and attendance patterns

Execute advanced SQL queries for HR insights

Provide analytical reporting for decision-making

Demonstrate SQL proficiency with real-world business datasets

# Database Schema
## Employee Table

Contains core employee information:

Employee ID

First & Last Name

Email

Department

Job ID

Joining date

## SalaryBonus Table

Captures:

Job ID

Salary amount

Bonus amount

Total earnings

## Leaves Table

Tracks employee leave behavior:

Leave ID

Employee ID

Leave date

Leave type

Duration

Deduction impact

# Skills & SQL Concepts Demonstrated
## SQL Fundamentals

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, DISTINCT

Data filtering & conditional logic

## Joins / Multi-table Queries

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN


## Aggregations

SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

Group-level analytics

## Advanced SQL

Subqueries

CTEs (WITH statements)

Pattern filtering

Data ranking (if required)

## Business-Focused SQL

Monthly payroll calculation

Top salary earners

Leave impact analysis

Department-level performance metrics

# Key Insights Derived
## Salary & Bonus Analysis

Identified highest-earning employees

Ranked departments by total payroll

Analyzed bonus distribution patterns

## Leave Analytics

Calculated yearly leave counts

Identified employees with abnormal leave frequency

Found leave types contributing to max deductions

## Department-Level Insights

Salary diversity across departments

Departments contributing highest total bonuses

Employee count distribution

## Workforce Behavior Patterns

Join-date based analysis

Year-wise employee leave behavior

Pay–performance correlations (from salary + bonus trend)

# Project Highlights
## Practical Business Scenario

Designed to mimic a real HR analytics backend used by organizations.

## Rich SQL Query Set

Every query connects to a real business question such as:

“Which department has the highest payroll?”

“Which employee took the most leaves this year?”

“What is the total bonus distribution?”

“Which employees generate the highest cost?”

## Clear, Modular SQL File

The SQL is organized into:

Table creation

Insert statements

Analytical queries

Bonus / salary insights

Leave analytics
